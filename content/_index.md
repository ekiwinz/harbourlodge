#####
Harbour Lodge Wellington opened in February 2004. It is
situated on a quiet hillside amongst beautiful native NZ bush, with
all-day sun and sweeping harbour views. All this is only a few minutes
drive from Wellington centre, Wellington Stadium and the ferry
terminal. Relax on the large sunny deck overlooking Wellington harbour,
sip a glass of superb NZ wine and listen to the tuis and other native
birds singing in the surrounding bush. Idly watch as the ferries curve
in and out of the harbour and the yachts drift by. Enjoy a dip in the
heated pool, or on cooler evenings warm up around a crackling fire in
the spacious guest lounge, or treat yourself to a sauna or spa.</p>


The guest rooms have been refurbished to the highest quality with
king-size beds and snowy white linen. Each room has a private bathroom
and views across the gorge to the native bush-clad hills or harbour.
CableTV, and tea and coffee-making facilities are available in each
room.</p>

Let your stresses be gently lulled away in the luxurious comfort of
this beautiful new lodge.
